Airline-Reservation-Database-System
===================================

This is a airline reservation system I did for a class database project.  I wrote all of the front-end files and my other teammates
did the back-end files.  We used Java with JSP for the back-end, and a demonstration of this cannot be done on Github.
All of the front-end pages can be viewed as static pages at clarkstonehocker.github.io/Airline-Reservation-Database-System/index.html

All of the logins work with "clark" as the username and "1234" as the password.  Using these credentials will allow you to view the 
corresponding static pages.
